After working on it full time for about 8 months, we had to make the hard decision of shutting it down.\nOver the last few months after its shutdown, I have been introspecting on what went wrong and what could have been improved. This post is an attempt at documenting some of the lessons I learned from this endeavour.\nBefore diving into the lessons learned, it would be helpful to know what the startup was and the problem it was trying to solve.\nWhat was BajaarApp? Background Vast majority of the commerce in emerging countries like India, happen through offline markets – also known as bazaars. These are traditional markets with small \u0026 medium shops on either side of the road. In one form or the other, Bazaars exist in almost all emerging countries, from southeast Asia to the Middle East and from Africa to latin America.\nPeople shop from bazaars because they provide non-branded goods at a cheaper price point – the only catch is you have to inspect and try out products before buying it. In markets where people bargain for every single rupee, lower prices are quite important. That is one of the main reasons why people still shop from bazaars despite their many shortcomings.\nProblem One of the biggest problems in bazaars is product discovery, or so did I think. Consumers usually visit multiple shops to find a good match for their quality-price range.\nI believed that product discovery in bazaars was a big problem, because I had felt it myself. When I was shopping for my wedding clothes in 2019, I faced this problem first hand. To find the best clothes with high quality, good design and low prices, we had to visit over ten different shops. While growing up in India, I had always wondered “how do we know if what we’re buying is the best in the market for our price range? What if there is a shop in bazaar that has a better product but we simply don’t know it”. To really know that, we would have to visit every single shop in the bazaar and look at their merchandise; and that’s impossible!\nSolution BajaarApp was trying to solve the product discovery problem in local bazaars. Instead of having to visit multiple shops, we should just be able to find the product through a products search engine.\nBajaarApp started out as low tech as possible, focusing on a rather small geographic region – Rajkot, Gujarat a tier-3 city in India.\nCold start problem Because BajaarApp had two sides – merchants and buyers, it had the cold start problem (a.k.a chicken and egg problem). As a result, we had to be clever in getting initial users.\nMerchants were approached through a combination of Facebook ads and in-person shop visits. They would send photos of their merchandise over WhatsApp and Facebook page. These photos would be manually curated and uploaded to BajaarApp servers. Merchants would receive inquiries from interested buyers through WhatsApp. That allowed merchants to try out the platform without having to install and learn a new app. Gradually all of this was automated through a dedicated merchant app.\nOnce there was a critical mass of products in a category, we would start showing Facebook ads for that category. These ads would take buyers to a webpage showing products in that category. From this webpage, interested buyers can initiate a WhatsApp conversation with the corresponding merchant directly. In addition to the website, buyers were encouraged to install the mobile app.\nTraction This approach allowed both sides to try out BajaarApp without having to install the app.\nAs a result of this strategy, BajaarApp gained considerable traction in its small market. Here are the stats from August 2020.\n    Monthly Weekly     Buyers on Web 29 K 7.1 K   Buyers on Android App 1 K 389   Number of conversations initiated 3.09 K 721    On the merchant side, we had some level of organic growth. Merchants would notice their peers having some degree of success on BajaarApp and approach us for posting their products on the platform. This organic growth was especially pronounced among household businesses and shops located in non-prime locations of bazaar, because they really wanted to get discovered by buyers. The shops in prime locations of bazaars didn’t need to be on the platform as they already had so much foot traffic simply due to their physical locations, and so shops located in prominent areas weren’t as enthusiastic.\nOn the buyer’s side however, we didn’t have much organic traffic. Despite our best attempts to convert paid traffic into organic visits, the organic traffic remained low. This is explored in detail in the section below.\nProblems Encountered For any search engine to be successful on its own, the following condition has to hold:\n Large number of users have to be searching repeatedly.\n For BajaarApp specifically this meant the following.\n#1: Start buying journey at BajaarApp Enough users would have to start their buying journey from BajaarApp (web or mobile) for the search engine model to work.\nAs we discovered, not enough users were organically starting their buying journey from BajaarApp. We had a ton of users visiting us from ads on facebook/instagram feeds, but despite our best attempts, very few of them were converting into native app users. Even the ones that successfully converted didn’t use BajaarApp the next time they wanted to buy something in bazaars.\nOne of the main reasons was that users in this market aren’t used to pulling for information. This is evident in the most popular apps in this market. Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp and TikTok are all passive in nature. Searching or category navigation is inherently a pull operation – i.e. pulling and filtering for information that the user wants.\nThis meant that for BajaarApp to work, enough of the buyers would have to change their behaviour. Generally users only change their behaviour if they get enough benefits from the new solution to justify the pain of learning the new thing.\n#2: High Retention The buyers would have to have a high retention rate – i.e. search over and over again.\nOn the buyers side, BajaarApp’s retention rate was low: 28d retention was around 3%. Despite our best attempts to improve that, we simply could not get it to be at acceptable levels.\nAlternatives: Traditional Marketplace Model You might ask, why didn’t you try the traditional marketplace model where the marketplace takes a cut of each transaction (e.g. Amazon, eBay, Etsy, Faire, Airbnb, Uber, DoorDash and many more).\nWe did consider it. And concluded that it would not work in bazaars for two main reasons:\n  To extract transaction fees, the marketplace has to strictly be between buyers and sellers. In other words, with this model buyers and sellers can not be allowed to connect directly or else they would disintermediate the platform. Without letting buyers and sellers connect, buyers can’t inspect and try out the product before making a purchase decision. That is an important feature of bazaars – especially so because of the non-branded nature of the merchandise.\n  The burden of transaction fee ultimately gets passed on to the buyers in the form of higher prices. As noted earlier, people shop from local bazaars primarily because it provides them with economical products. Increased prices would take away this advantage of bazaars.\n  Lessons Learned Among the many things that I learned, here are some of most important lessons.\nPain v/s Inconvenience As noted earlier in the Problems Encountered section above, buyers weren’t changing their behaviour around buying journey. Users typically only change their behaviour if the value from the new solution is high enough to compensate for pain of change.\nBased on that reasoning, it’s safe to conclude that product discovery isn’t a significant enough pain point to warrant such a behaviour change. In that sense, the problem of product discovery turned out to be an inconvenience. Startups need to solve a big-burning pain point – without that, it’s impossible to sustain and scale it.\nPart of me wonders if I could have somehow figured this all out without launching a product and iterating on it for a few months. That probably would have saved me a few months of time and energy.\nSkillset While working on BajaarApp, I realized the importance of Product Management and Design.\nComing from a deep engineering background, my belief was that engineering is the most important skill set. As an engineer at Google, I optimized towards working on the coolest and toughest engineering problems (ranking, machine perception etc).\nNow I am convinced that in today’s world of commoditized technology, product management is the main differentiator for successful startups especially during early stages! Anyone can build websites and apps. But figuring out what to develop – talking to users, analyzing their behaviour, figuring out their pain points and then coming up with a solution is the most important skill for consumer product startups. Had I known this 5 years ago when I was at the beginning of my career, I probably would have made different career choices.\nIt’s never too late to learn anything though. With that in mind, one of my personal goals is to master product related skills. Today I am probably at the beginners level, hopefully I can become an expert at product in time for my next startup!\nAcknowledgement I want to take this opportunity and express my sincerest gratitude to my mentors that guided me through this startup. Specifically I want to thank John Capucitti, Marcelo Cortes, Jay Shah and last but not least Mila Banerjee for their wonderful mentorship and guidance. I am also especially thankful to the Velocity Incubator and the entire team.\nHopefully, the lessons I learned through this endeavour will help me in my future startups! 😉 🤞\n","wordCount":"1639","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2020-12-12T18:08:10-05:00","dateModified":"2020-12-12T18:08:10-05:00","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Jay Nakrani"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://jaynakrani.com/posts/bajaarapp-retro-and-lessons/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Jay Nakrani","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://jaynakrani.com/favicon.ico"}}}</script>

<h3 id=problems-encountered>Problems Encountered<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#problems-encountered>#</a></h3>
<p>For any search engine to be successful on its own, the following condition has to hold:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>Large number of users</strong></em> have to be searching <em><strong>repeatedly</strong></em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For BajaarApp specifically this meant the following.</p>
<h4 id=1-start-buying-journey-at-bajaarapp>#1: Start buying journey at BajaarApp<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#1-start-buying-journey-at-bajaarapp>#</a></h4>
<p>Enough users would have to start their buying journey from BajaarApp (web or mobile) for the search engine model to work.</p>
<p>As we discovered, not enough users were organically starting their buying journey from BajaarApp. We had a ton of users visiting us from ads on facebook/instagram feeds, but despite our best attempts, very few of them were converting into native app users. Even the ones that successfully converted didn’t use BajaarApp the next time they wanted to buy something in bazaars.</p>
<p>One of the main reasons was that users in this market aren’t used to pulling for information. This is evident in the most popular apps in this market. Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp and TikTok are all passive in nature. Searching or category navigation is inherently a pull operation &ndash; i.e. pulling and filtering for information that the user wants.</p>

<h4 id=2-high-retention>#2: High Retention<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#2-high-retention>#</a></h4>
<p>The buyers would have to have a high retention rate &ndash; i.e. search over and over again.</p>
<p>On the buyers side, BajaarApp’s retention rate was low: 28d retention was around 3%. Despite our best attempts to improve that, we simply could not get it to be at acceptable levels.</p>
<h3 id=alternatives-traditional-marketplace-model>Alternatives: Traditional Marketplace Model<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#alternatives-traditional-marketplace-model>#</a></h3>
<p>You might ask, why didn’t you try the traditional marketplace model where the marketplace takes a cut of each transaction (e.g. Amazon, eBay, Etsy, Faire, Airbnb, Uber, DoorDash and many more).</p>
<p>We did consider it. And concluded that it would not work in bazaars for two main reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>To extract transaction fees, the marketplace has to strictly be between buyers and sellers. In other words, with this model buyers and sellers can not be allowed to connect directly or else they would disintermediate the platform.
<strong>Without letting buyers and sellers connect, buyers can’t inspect and try out the product before making a purchase decision.</strong> That is an important feature of bazaars &ndash; especially so because of the non-branded nature of the merchandise.</p>

<p>The burden of transaction fee ultimately gets passed on to the buyers in the form of higher prices. As noted earlier, people shop from local bazaars primarily because it provides them with economical products. <strong>Increased prices would take away this advantage of bazaars.</strong></p>

Startups need to solve a big-burning pain point &ndash; without that, it&rsquo;s impossible to sustain and scale it.</p>
<p>Part of me wonders if I could have somehow figured this all out without launching a product and iterating on it for a few months. That probably would have saved me a few months of time and energy.</p>
<h3 id=skillset>Skillset<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#skillset>#</a></h3>
<p>While working on BajaarApp, I realized the importance of Product Management and Design.</p>
<p>Coming from a deep engineering background, my belief was that engineering is the most important skill set. As an engineer at Google, I optimized towards working on the coolest and toughest engineering problems (ranking, machine perception etc).</p>
<p>Now I am convinced that in today’s world of commoditized technology, product management is the main differentiator for successful startups especially during early stages! Anyone can build websites and apps. But figuring out what to develop &ndash; talking to users, analyzing their behaviour, figuring out their pain points and then coming up with a solution is <em><strong>the most important skill for consumer product startups</strong></em>. Had I known this 5 years ago when I was at the beginning of my career, I probably would have made different career choices.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s never too late to learn anything though. With that in mind, one of my personal goals is to master product related skills. Today I am probably at the beginners level, hopefully I can become an expert at product in time for my next startup!</p>
<h2 id=acknowledgement>Acknowledgement<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#acknowledgement>#</a></h2>
<p>I want to take this opportunity and express my sincerest gratitude to my mentors that guided me through this startup. Specifically I want to thank <a href=https://www.linkedin.com/in/johncappuccitti/>John Capucitti</a>, <a href=https://www.linkedin.com/in/marcelo-cortes-b34317/>Marcelo Cortes</a>, <a href=https://www.linkedin.com/in/jaykshah/>Jay Shah</a> and last but not least <a href=https://www.linkedin.com/in/milabanerjee/>Mila Banerjee</a> for their wonderful mentorship and guidance. I am also especially thankful to the <a href=https://velocityincubator.com/>Velocity Incubator</a> and the entire team.</p>
<p>Hopefully, the lessons I learned through this endeavour will help me in my future startups! 😉 🤞</p>
